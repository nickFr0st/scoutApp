<h2>Camp Import</h2>

<p>
    Files that are imported must have a .csv extension as such make sure that all your values are separated by commas.<br>
    It is important to note that when you specify an camp name that already exists in BSA Database this will <b>update the existing data.</b>
    To keep to existing scout participation list you must specify their names in the import.
    <br>
    When adding scout names please list all the scouts that have participated in a camp below that camp they participated in. To signify a new camp leave an empty
    space between the last camp or scout name and the name of the next camp.<br>
    The following table will explain what data is valid and how to build our import file. The type and max values are relate to the type of information that will be
    stored in the associated field (such as: Text or Number) and the maximum number of character allow in each field respectfully.<br>
